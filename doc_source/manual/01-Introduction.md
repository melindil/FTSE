## Introduction

### Fallout Tactics Scripting Engine (0.56a, August 15, 2024)

This mod enhances the game Fallout Tactics, adding the following capabilities:

## Configurable EXE patching
Most of the known hex-edits for the BOS executable file are included. Each can be selectively enabled or disabled from a configuration file. New edits can also be added without needing to directly edit the EXE, or rebuild the mod.

## Custom Scripting Engine
The mod will patch the BOS executable to load an included DLL, containing a Lua language interpreter, and interfaces to the Fallout Tactics data. The Lua code can specify code to execute at certain pre-defined trigger points within the game, and modify game variables in real-time to produce customized behaviors.
